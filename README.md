# opiodSite
This was a website that a group of 2 other students and I created for a compition we competed in for MCC. One other student and I were the
only ones to make anything for it due to the fact that we had to teach ourselves HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I also tried to impliment 
a RESTful API from google maps but was unable to get the second part of that page working properly. I was told to use a second API key 
to fix the issue at the compition and have not gotten around to trying to fix the issue. I will probably not be going and revisiting this
project. My pages are the map, index, and about us page.
