# Opiod Web Based Application
Tasked with creating an application that provided useful information to families and addicts in an integrated form, the result is a website that a team of two other students, from Manchester Community College, and I created to give our take on a web based application. The pages I created were countdownV2.html, info.htlm and the corresponding JavaScript and CSS files. Ultimately, we were never taught much of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript at MCC so we had to teach ourselves much of the languages but we gave our best shot at an integrated web based application.
