            in the state of Connecticut. That number is on the rise as the average deaths per month approaches
            one hundred. Opiod addiction is a serious issue and the only way to fight it is to be informed! If
            you know someone who may be sufferning from opiod addiction or if you believe that you are, please

            <div class= "write2"> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 
            years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
            and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable 
            source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
            (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on 
            the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, 
            "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of 
            Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 
            and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact 
            original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
