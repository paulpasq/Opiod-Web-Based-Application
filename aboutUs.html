        <div class="write1"> I’m Paul, 22, friendly and easy going. I want to take the 
        app and make it include a little of everything. I would love to add a timer down 
        to a date that an opiate user selects as a day to get clean, then have the timer
        count up from the days they have been clean, maybe rewarding them at every 
        milestone. I’d like to add another tab that explains
        how hard it may seem to get clean, but also the reasons why it’s worth it. Also a tab of the users 
        medical history, conditions, allergies, blood type, and medications, as well as 
        drug history so in case of an overdose; the first responders can look at the info 
        and use the valuable saved time to help the person. Also another tab with crisis 
        lines like suicide hotlines, local NA hotlines and even local clean sponsors.

        <div class="write2"> Anthony LaTorre: Attending Manchester Community College and graduating
        this coming winter. I love to program and write. I got introduced to this competition though
        my Java professor and ended up joining the team for MCC. For this project I have created the 
        homepage and the about us page so far. I plan to create a interative map that allows people
        to look up where the closest pharmacies are to them. I also created the navigation and 
        color scheme for the site. I want to try to use the API from the ct data site to create 
        something but I haven't been able to think of anything as of yet. I will hopefully be able
        to come up with something in the next few days however.
